On Valencia Street between 16th and 17th street, with its unmistakable blue facade, Bar Tartine dishes out some of the most labor intensive, and beautifully crafted dishes. The woody interior with rustic decor, and large windows adds a sense of European elegance, and makes time slow down.  OpenTable diners here are gaga about these dishes.

To quote a diner, "The beef tartare on Koji toast with bottarga was brilliant". Locally sourced beef with _Koji_ (Japanese kojia culture made by growing different fungi on cooked grains or legumes in a warm, humid place).Koji is also folded into the sourdough batter to give it that distinctive umami!

These Yukon gold beauties are first roasted, then smoked over alder wood, and then fried in rice bran oil. Served up with green garlic mayonnaise, these could as well be the best potatoes you will ever have!

Our next stop is Farina! Tucked away on 18th street between Valencia and Guerrero, its flat rectangular facade does not particularly strike as attractive (to me at least!). The food is another story!

A Ligurian speciality, this focacciaa consists of thin layers of warm bread dough filled with stracchino cheese!It is often served with proscuitto. One of the OpenTable diners says _"... Focaccia Di Recco Con Prosciutto Cotto, for this alone I will go back ..."_.
