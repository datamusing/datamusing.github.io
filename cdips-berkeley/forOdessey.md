On Valencia Street between 16th and 17th street, with its unmistakable blue facade, Bar Tartine dishes out some of the most labor intensive, and beautifully crafted dishes. The woody interior with rustic decor, and large windows adds a sense of European elegance, and makes time slow down.  OpenTable diners here are gaga about these dishes.  

##Beef Tartare on Koji Toast
![tartare](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/4431033/thumb_600.jpg?1390797587?1407303742)

To quote a diner, "The beef tartare on Koji toast with bottarga was brilliant". Locally sourced beef with _Koji_  (Japanese koji: a culture made by growing different fungi on cooked grains or legumes in a warm, humid place). Koji is also folded into the sourdough batter to give it that distinctive umami!

Our next stop is Farina! Tucked away on 18th street between Valencia and Guerrero, its flat rectangular facade does not particularly strike as attractive (to me at least!). The food is another story!   

The star dish here seems to be the 
##Focaccia di Recco

A Ligurian speciality, this focaccia consists of thin layers of warm bread dough filled with stracchino cheese!It is often served with proscuitto. One of the OpenTable diners says _"... Focaccia Di Recco Con Prosciutto Cotto, for this alone I will go back ..."_.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. Situated in the heart of the Mission district, this nationally and internationally acclaimed restaurant serves up impeccable Californian cuisine with a Mediterranean twist. Once dark,  independent and international movies are screened the back wall in their large courtyard in this unique industrial chic venue. 

There are several dishes here including the oyster sampler that people are raving about, but if I had to pick just one dish, it would be the fried chicken! 

##Sesame Fried Chicken

As one of the OpenTable diners puts it --- "_All of our choices were spot on. Fried chicken - oh my!_".  Marinated overnight with a hint of Madras curry and chili, then fried up with sesame seed infused batter to crispy perfection, it is a dish that you will remember for a long time!

![garcon](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18915298/blog/mission_food/garcon.jpg)

This is a little slice of France at the corner of 22nd and Valencia, presumably named after the movie 'Garçon!' by French auteur Claude Sautet. Chef Arthur Wall specializes in classic French dishes conjured up with seasonal and local ingredients!  

Diners here seem to be consistently drooling over the coq au vin! 

##Coq Au Vin

![Flour + Water](http://slice.seriouseats.com/images/20101104flourwateroutside.jpg)

Flour+Water is probably the hottest Italian restaurant in San Francisco,   distinguished for a menu showcasing the regional Italian traditions with Northern California influences.  While you can't go wrong with the pasta and pizza here, the one dish not to miss is the chocolate budino.

Heirloom cafe is a labor of love of its owners, with the simple philosophy of bringing fresh seasonal food and first-rate wines to the table at a very agreeable price point. Its industrial chic design, and casual atmosphere makes it a friendly and intimate place to relax and make new friends over good food and good wine! 

##bacon and onion tart
![bacon_onion_tart](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/4806179/thumb_600.jpg?1403575100?1407700818)

One of their most talked about dishes happens to be the bacon and onion tart, which is true to its roots in the Alsatian classic tarte flambée. To quote one of the OpenTable diners here " ... bacon and onion tart was classic and perfect, with a delicate, buttery crust and deeply caramelized onions."

The always busy Valencia branch of Limon Rotisserie is well known for its Peruvian comfort food, and pisco sours!   But it seems that one item is on everyone's mind:

##Sweet potato fries

![sweet potato fries](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/336109/thumb_600.jpg?1296890230?1407701181)

This casually hip comfort food heaven at the corner of 18th and Valencia is loved by locals and tourists alike for its affordable yet deletable menu. If you go there, do not leave without dipping into their 
## warm goat cheese fondue

![fondue](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/1282126/thumb_600.JPG?1328295094?1407702038)

The fondue is served over slices of green apple and to toasted bread! 
A testament from an OpenTable diner: _"The food has something added to it that makes it delicious and incredible--the goat cheese fondue always hit the spot!"_

![Nombe](http://www.bonappetit.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nombe_izakaya-sf.jpg)

Nombe is one my favorite casual dining restaurants in the Mission. Nombe brings the concept of the _izakaya_ --- a Japanese  drinking establishment which also serves food --- to  the heart of the mission district. In my opinion its decor is not very reminiscent of a Japanese izakaya, but the food is completely spot on! 
Everyone here is raving about the unique burger that has become synonymous with Nombe! 

##The Ramenburger
![ramen burger](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/3942008/thumb_600.jpg?1376779987?1407703201)

This almost slider sized beauty has a patty made with 50/50 blend of pork belly and Wagyu beef, while the bun is formed  with pan sautéed ramen accented with aonori and sesame. Between the ramen buns and the patty you'll find caramelized onions, tomatoes, mizuna salad,  and shio-koji picked japanese cucumbers! There are various add-ons to chose from, but whichever you chose, it is always super tasty!

![Range](http://www.eatspeaksf.com/.a/6a0168ebd82b5b970c017d414192ed970c-pi)

Range is a constantly evolving gem of a restaurant situated just beside the Mission playground. Since its opening in 2005, Range has pioneered a new breed of restaurants that gradually adorned that stretch of Valencia street!
Seems like they must be doing something right with their  chicken liver mousse, as it is the most talked about item on their menu!

Another casual industrial chic institution in the Mission, Slow Club features a changing menu featuring the freshest  local ingredients, matched with zesty cocktails, delicious wines, and beers. Among many dishes that keep appearing on the menu and are loved by the patrons, the pork loin dish stands out! 

##Grilled pork loin
![grilled pork loin](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/1847394/thumb_600.jpg?1338878560?1407703505)

This Opentable diner summarizes the dish very nicely: _-"The pork loin was my dinner option, and it was ridiculously awesome - the yam puree made it taste like dessert, helped tremendously by the pancetta and granny smith apple hash."_

Owned by James Beard Award-winning sommelier and author David Lynch, St. Vincent offers an extensive wine list (every wine can be ordered by the half-bottle).  The excellent wine selection is complemented by a hearty Californian menu that emphasizes local  and seasonal ingredients. 

One of the top dishes here is the bone marrow. 

##Bone marrow

The succulent bone marrow dish is served with spring onions, smoked chilies, mustard frill and toast! Paired with a glass of robust red, it should be a win win situation!
