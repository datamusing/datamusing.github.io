Dear Data Wranglers, 

I made these pages so that we can keep track of our progress with the two data science problems we are tackling for this workshop! 

Here you will find the guidelines, with occasional code snippets, tips and tricks,
If you make cool figures I will put them up here against the respective project. 


Lets have some fun with data, shall we?
