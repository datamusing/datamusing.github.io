#Getting Some Data 

Here is a data set that is as new to you as it is to me! Lets see what we can do with it! 

I hope you guys are already a little  savvy with Pandas, but this one youâ€™ll need to crack a bit to get the data into a Pandas Dataframe:

Here is a set of reviews of [fine foods from Amazon](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html)

Your first assignment is to get the data into a Pandas data frame, preferably in an python notebook. 
Then, rank the products by the number of reviews they have. Also for the most reviewed item plot the distribution of star ratings. 

Remember to save the dataframe into a JSON file so that we can readily read it back in. 

Finally, just go nuts with the data, and find out interesting things about ratings and the reviews., e.g., does the length of the review correlate with the rating?
